Gosh, another day and another mission.

Its another day and another mission, all in good fun today.

Final days ahead for the enemy. How do they take it?

That's going to be interesting of hitting these targets, looking forward to it.

Wonder what the enemy has awaiting for us today.

I get funny feeling about this one, maybe the enemy has something special awaiting for us today, so I guess its better to keep my act tight.

So we have another large mission ahead of us, well that's why I joined the military...

Good morning <ISLAND_NAME>, meet my team, who are here to kill all of the enemy, hooayh!

I have some bullets awaiting for for the enemy, I'm expecting them to meet soon.

Oh man that was some helluva fight, we really stopped them on their tracks!

Oh man that was some helluva fight, we really pushed forward like nothing today!

Another defend mission ahead of us, how much juice the enemy has got left?

Time to move forward again, I love this stuff so much. Lets bring the fight to the enemy!

Feeling bit oozy today, but hey its nothing I cant handle. But I must focus to keep my buddies alive and not make stupid mistakes.

Without my buddies I'm nothing, well more or less. With them I can do great things, like blowing up all the enemy forces that face me. Bring it on baby!

If I have to capture another set of <TARGET_TYPE> I go outta my mind. Man I need some R and R...

The end is here. This is it. The final push to eject the <ENEMY_NAME> army from <ISLAND_NAME>.

New beginning on <ISLAND_NAME>. New opportunity to kick some <ENEMY_NAME> ass!

Hooyah, boots on the ground in <ISLAND_NAME>!

Man what a fight, and they still keep coming. Damn this war is getting tough, well grab your ammo and lets do this, I'm ready!

I am lucky to be alive let me tell you that right now. The enemy attacks were so fierce and strong that I seriously didn't think I'll make it, but I did. I'm still here, ready to fight some more.

Actually I kind of like this <ISLAND_NAME> countryside, it reminds me of home, little bit.

Boy I didn't see that counterattack coming, well now I know, now I'm ready. Bring it on you bastards!

Hear the silence? I don't. I hear gunfire, explosions, screams and suffering. Hooayh! all caused by my troops, lets go and do some more damage!

Okay so another counterattack coming, OK this time I'll do some major damage with minimum losses to friendly forces.

Here they come again, oh man, how long this is going to last this time.

<TARGET_TYPE> fell good, I enjoyed that mission. Hopefully today we get to see some good action again, I'm up for it and so are my guys.

Hey, this actually is working pretty good, we make good advances and the enemy doesn't seem to be match to us. I like it.

Today I'm going to blow some <ENEMY_NAME> up...

Foothold in <ISLAND_NAME>, hooyah baby! Its awesome feeling to step into virgin terrain, I just love freeing up these islands from the dirty <ENEMY_NAME> hands.

My squad looks confident, I see nobody having any doubts of the upcoming missions, that's always good.

Just when I thought of we getting away easy, enemy hits us with all their got. OK bring it on <ENEMY_NAME>, I'm expecting you.

Well we survived that, but whats next?

Wonder how my parents feels back home as I'm fighting this war far away.

<TARGET_TYPE> fight was intense, really intense. Everyone is like shook up after that fight.

Enemy is assaulting, well let them come, saves me from the trouble of going looking after them. Just give me some ammo and guys, I'll handle it.

<ISLAND_AREA> is going to fall baby!

Time to move <ISLAND_AREA>, wonder how it is like there...

Okay boys, lets get ready to toast some <ENEMY_NAME>.

I'm so looking forward of finishing this <ISLAND_NAME> operation.

<ENEMY_NAME> are attacking, man your positions boys!

Big battle in <TARGET_TYPE>, I consider myself lucky that I survived it, many guys didn't...

One step forward and the enemy strikes back, where do they get the forces to do this, damn <ENEMY_NAME>.

Time to bust some heads.

Time to kill some OPFOR scum.
